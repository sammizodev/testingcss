		<h3>	Doctrinal Statement Of UESI<p>
				There are ten doctrinal statements that together form the UESI Statements of Faith. They are:</h3>evangelical, interdenominational, historical and scriptural in nature and are as follows:<br>
				<p>
				The unity of the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit in the Godhead.<p>
				The Sovereignty of God in creation, revelation, redemption and final judgment.<p>
				The divine inspiration and infallibility of Holy Scripture (by which we understand the 66 books<p>of the Bible), as originally given, and its supreme authority in all matters of faith and conduct.<p>
				The universal sinfulness and guilt of human nature since the fall, rendering man subject to <p>God’s wrath and condemnation.<p>
				Redemption from the guilt, penalty and power of sin only through the sacrificial death (as our <p>Representative and Substitute) of Jesus Christ, the incarnate Son of God.<p>
				The resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead.<p>
				The necessity of the work of the Holy Spirit to make the death of Christ effective to the<p> individual sinner, granting him repentance towards God and faith in Jesus Christ.<br>
				The indwelling and work of the Holy Spirit in the believer.<p>
				The only holy universal Church, which is the Body of Christ, and to which all believers belong.<p>
				The expectation of the personal return of the Lord Jesus Chris<p>

		<B>MESSAGE FROM UESI PRESIDENT</B><p>
		<i><h3>It is indeed a great joy for me to greet you through this letter that I am writing during the UESI PRAYER FORTNIGHT bridging our formation day on 18 September to the National Prayer Day on 2nd October. At the outset may I record my sincere appreciations to my immediate predecessor, Dr. Joseph John who has led the movement as UESI President from 2011-12 to 2015-16 in a very effective manner. God has blessed the community through his dedicated services. Let us praise God for him and his family.<p><P>

		My heart is filled with deep gratitude for the enormous efforts made by my predecessors who served in the UESI Boards to adopt amended constitution, drafting UESI Operations Handbook (inner workings) and model framework for decentralized states for uniformity, bringing reformation in staff appointment, salary, and welfare schemes. They have laid the foundation for future growth of UESI as a national body. In this back drop, the current board has the urgent responsibility to finalize the UESI operations handbook and model framework for decentralization through consultative meetings so as to arrive at a consensus conducive for a federal structure like UESI, framing a new HR policy for staff and achieving the goals of VISION 2020 and beyond. At the same time, we need to revisit our financial provisions so that our staff can get support which is in conformity with the price rise, inflation and growing cost of living. These can be possible if all of us pray on our knees continuously and seek God’s enabling power to expand our support bases, and also taking personal vows not to withhold any benefit/support which the Spirit of God expects us to offer to UESI. To this end I humbly beseech all Graduates (young and old) and students to come forward to own the ministry as your own self and work hand in hand to take the UESI ministry to newer heights for the glory of God’s Kingdom.

		The fields are ripe unto harvest. So let us ask the Lord of harvest to choose more workers from among us – as tentmakers, short termers and as UESI Staff for the furtherance of His Kingdom. Our Zonal Secretaries will work with the State leaderships to facilitate the above.

		As a movement, we have several challenges to address as we move forward, increasing needs for finances in particular. It is now 45 Lacs per month that is required for the ministry at National. The ministry at State levels too are growing. Let us pray that God will sustain this growth pace with a growth in giving too across the country.

		Finally, I bring greetings to you from the National Board. As a core team, Dr. Arul Manohar, Brother Clement Barnabas, Brother Reji Daniel and I meet on a weekly basis, JUST TO PRAY for each other and the ministry at large. May I request all the UESI STEWARDS, serving in various roles at Zones, State, Districts and Local to practice this weekly time of intense prayer.

		<h1>With Love, Regards and Prayers,<br>
		Yours in His Vineyard,<br>
